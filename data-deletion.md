## About Our Application

The n8n application, operated by Jones Medical Management LLC (doing business as Dr. Jones Team), accesses Facebook Page and Instagram business account data on behalf of authorized page administrators to read and respond to comments on social media posts.

**We do not store personal data of Facebook or Instagram users on our servers.** User data such as comment text and commenter names is processed in real-time to generate comment replies and is not retained after processing. We do retain summaries of our own Page and Instagram posts (e.g., topic and content descriptions) to provide context for generating replies. These summaries contain no personal user information.


## How to Remove App Access

If you are a page administrator who previously authorized the n8n application, you can revoke its access at any time by following these steps:

**Facebook:**

1. Go to **Facebook Settings & Privacy** > **Settings**
2. Click **Apps and Websites** (under "Security and login" or "Apps")
3. Find **n8n** in the list of active apps
4. Click **Remove**
5. Confirm removal

**Instagram:**

1. Open the **Instagram** app or go to Instagram on the web
2. Go to **Settings and privacy** > **Website permissions** > **Apps and websites**
3. Find **n8n** in the list of active apps
4. Click **Remove**
5. Confirm removal

Once removed, the application will no longer have access to your Page or Instagram account data. Since we do not store any personal user data, no deletion of your information is required on our end.

**# DATA DELETION INSTRUCTIONS**

**Last updated February 19, 2026**


## About Our Application

The n8n application, operated by Jones Medical Management LLC (doing business as Dr. Jones Team), accesses Facebook Page and Instagram business account data on behalf of authorized page administrators to read and respond to comments on social media posts.

**We do not store personal data of Facebook or Instagram users on our servers.** All data (comment text, commenter names, post context) is processed in real-time to generate comment replies and is not retained after processing.


## How to Remove App Access

If you are a page administrator who previously authorized the n8n application, you can revoke its access at any time by following these steps:

**Facebook:**

1. Go to **Facebook Settings & Privacy** > **Settings**
2. Click **Apps and Websites** (under "Security and login" or "Apps")
3. Find **n8n** in the list of active apps
4. Click **Remove**
5. Confirm removal

**Instagram:**

1. Open the **Instagram** app or go to Instagram on the web
2. Go to **Settings and privacy** > **Website permissions** > **Apps and websites**
3. Find **n8n** in the list of active apps
4. Click **Remove**
5. Confirm removal

Once removed, the application will no longer have access to your Page or Instagram account data. Since we do not store user data, no additional deletion is required on our end.
